# Problem 2
```{r}

y <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)

# 2a)
x+1

x+y #vector x cannot be recycled properly but default behaviour is to start the shorter vector from beginning
x*y #ditto
# 2b)
length(x)
length(y)
# 2c)
sum(x>5) # number of digits above 5; TRUE = 1
sum(x[x>5]) # sum all digits above 5
# 2d)
y[-3] # exclude 3rd index
y[x] # use x as indices
y[y >= 7] # all numbers above 7
# 2e)
c(x, y) # combine x and y
